Very nice job. You coded quite a lot in MATLAB and Python. Would you please present some of your code tomorrow?? I particularly like that you normalized those electric field vectors, they can be quite a pain to graph and see what is going on if they are unscaled. The only criticism of the code is that you could have avoided the double for loops (for loops are quite computationally expensive) if you used some of the array capabilities of MATLAB and Python - but that does take some time to do, and I even used for loops in my solution to save time - just something to keep in mind if you ever run over tons of data.
